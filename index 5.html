    <h1>Starting A Business Blog Is A Must For Success</h1>
    <p>
      For your business to thrive in today’s online world, a strong online
      presence is a must.<br />
      Paid advertising on AdWords and social platforms will produce immediate
      results, but for long-term success, nothing trumps content marketing.
      <br />And it all begins with what I call “home base” — your website’s
      blog. <br />Blogging serves as the base for all other digital outlets; it
      provides content for social media, newsletters and a source for other
      websites to attribute and link to. <br />The most successful businesses —
      from small to midsize businesses (SMBs) to enterprise — think like
      publishers when producing content. <br />They save all of their product
      and service information for the main sales pages of their websites.<br />
      Some even build subdomains dedicated solely to blogging.<br />

      As Content Marketing Institute Founder Joe Pulizzi reveals in his book,
      “Epic Content Marketing,” a business must think of content marketing as an
      asset — not just another expense.<br />
      Blogging is that asset’s foundation. Here’s how to make it work:

      <br />Focus on reader needs, not your service or product.<br />

      Too many business blogs discuss services and products, which immediately
      turns off readers. <br />Save that language for your main service pages.
      Instead, focus on adding value to the reader through education and/or
      entertainment.
